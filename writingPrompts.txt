Feynman Writing Prompts

1. Objects
Objects are variables, but contain many different properties related to the object. These properties are written
in 'key:value' pairs.


2. Properties
You can think of a JavaScript object like you would any real-world object.
A car is an object which has properties, brand: honda, color: white, numberOfDoors: 4.
Properties in objects follow this 'key:value' format.

3. Methods
A properties value can be a function which is called a method when inside an object.
A method is an action that can be performed on an object.

4. for in loop
This is a loop which can iterate over the different keys in an object. It goes key by key on the specified object.
This gives you access to every key and value in an object without knowing the key name.

5. dot notation vs bracket notation
Dot and bracket notation are both used for accessing a property on an object.
The object name, then a dot, and then the property name allows you to access a property.
You could also put the object name followed by the property name in brackets.
Dot notation is used more frequently, but bracket notation allows you to enter variable names
when you don't know what the key is at that time (dynamically determined).
